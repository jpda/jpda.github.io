[Library Post](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/store/library-post-WA104080024.aspx?redir=0)​ is now in the store! Email-enabled document libraries were taken out of SharePoint Online due to some technical restrictions (AD Access, mainly), but were a _huge_ part of some company’s workflow. I’m happy to announce that we’ve built an app that brings back email-enabled libraries &amp; adds some additional features to boot.

#### What do I get?!

*   Email enabled libraries — you pick the address
*   Email enabled folders — you can assign folders within libraries email addresses, making your workflow that much easier
*   Assign the same address to multiple libraries — want to store multiple copies of the message? Set two or more folders/libraries to use the same address &amp; all mail sent will be put in each folder with that address.
