The past week has been full of sensationalist news of the ‘impending doom’ of a winter storm here in Charlotte. While many places north and west of here got plenty of snow (12”+ in Asheville, 24”+ in some higher elevations), we got a cold rain, and some on-and-off sleet. Most of the rain last night was freezing rain, and was gross. When I got up this morning, the sun was out and things were already melting. We took a little drive to go get some coffee, and most of our roads are dry in North Charlotte and Northern Mecklenburg County.

Anyway, a couple trees fell over in our parking lot, and there was a glaze on some of the trees, but it was pretty much still a non-event. Here are some photos:
