Hello.

My name is John (or JP, or John Patrick - like Alexa, I have many wake words). I've been building software for a while. In late 2010 I started using AWS and Azure, and quickly had an epiphany about cloud and how useful it is to me as a developer. I've had the advantage of working with cloud, primarily Azure, for almost a decade now, so I've been fortunate to have used many different pieces and parts of the platform. I've learned a lot along the way and use this as a place to share that with others. Take a look around, feel free to reach out.
