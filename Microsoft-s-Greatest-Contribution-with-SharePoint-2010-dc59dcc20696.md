I came across this doing some testing of SharePoint 2010. This may be one of the driving forces that really stands a chance of getting rid of those who are still stuck in 1999 that insist upon using IE6. According to last month’s report, 23% of all internet traffic is _still_ generated by IE6 — and the vast majority of those IE6 users are corporations and businesses. Hopefully this will push those users into this decade.
