I’ll be speaking at [SharePoint Saturday](http://www.spsevents.org/city/Charlotte/CLT2014/speakers) in Charlotte on September 20th. My session is on building a ‘shim’ for passive logon to Microsoft Online Services (Office 365, Azure, any federated apps) so you can do whatever kind of wild and crazy business logic you need to do. Should be fun!
