Got a new development machine today at work. Installed Server 2008 R2 Core as the underlying OS, planning to load a bunch of VMs for whatever I might need.

Since Server 2008 R2 Core supports .net (Server 2008 did not), I found that SQL Server 2008 will install without issue. It’s unsupported, but works.

This got me thinking…what if SharePoint can be installed as well?

Building a Server Core virtual…will update with progress soon.
