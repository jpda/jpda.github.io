What a wild few weeks — Build saw the official announcement of Service Fabric and some other hot Azure news and Ignite saw Azure for Enterprise/Azure Stack and loads of other announcements. Busily digesting everything new, but I’ll be at the [Triangle Azure User Group May 26th](http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Azure-User-Group-TriAUG/events/222519224/?a=socialmedia) talking about *something* new. Just not sure _what_ yet. I’m between Service Fabric and Event Hubs → Stream Analytics → Power BI. Or it could be something completely different, who knows. Regardless, come out for some food, networking and my marginally coherent ramblings about some new thing.
