So…when Steve and I were in Las Vegas at the SharePoint Conference, we met up with a friend of Steve’s named Nick — who just happens to own [Lightning Tools](http://lightningtools.com/), a UK company that dominates the BDC (now the BCS). While we were there, they took a few minutes to interview us about our SharePoint implementation at Skanska. You can listen to it below, and find the original post [here](http://www.sharepointpodshow.com/archive/2009/12/09/spc-interviews-episode-39.aspx).
