I just got back from a week in Las Vegas at SharePoint Conference 2009. To say the very least, it was an incredible experience — tons of new SharePoint 14 stuff, lots of new people, and a couple of experiences that will last a long time.

I’ll try to write more about it later, but by far the best sessions centered around the Client Object Model — a unified data-access API regardless of the client — Silverlight, Javascript or .net CF — not to mention strongly-typed support for REST.
