We poke around the SharePoint API a lot here at WTFHQ. Unfortunately, unless you explicitly set the accepts header, SharePoint sends everything back as XML…which is cool, if you’re 407 years old.

So I built a little extension for Google Chrome that adds the Accepts header to get json, then pretty prints &amp; syntax highlights the response. Pretty simple, not much to it, but saves me some time.
