In case that rock you’ve been living under is particularly dense, the Windows Phone Mango beta 2 update has arrived for registered developers, along with the 2nd beta of the Windows Phone Developer Tools.

You can get the dev tools here: [http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=26648](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=26648)

And if you’re a registered developer, you should have gotten a Connect invitation sometime around mid-day. My update process went fine, and took about an hour.
