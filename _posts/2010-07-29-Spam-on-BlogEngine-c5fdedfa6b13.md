Comment spam is unbelievable. I’ve gotten over 2500 spam comments since the the beginning of July. The akismet and StopForumSpam filters are helping keep it off of the posts, but the notifications keep on coming. I’m working on a BE.net plugin to send an email only when a comment is filtered, so hopefully someone else can get some benefit too.
