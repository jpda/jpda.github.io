Here’s a sweet little tidbit on Outlook 2010. When RSS Feed support was added in Office 2007, it was great — no extra feed readers necessary…except that all of your RSS Feeds would take up space in your Exchange account, if you were using Exchange. There are many methods out there for dealing with this, including a registry hack that would allow you to store your RSS Feeds in an external PST.

With Outlook 2010, however, they’ve already hooked it up by default. When you subscribe to a new feed, it’ll automatically create a new, local PST, and add your feed to it. How sweet is that?!
